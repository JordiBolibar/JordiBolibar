### Hi there, I'm Jordi Bolibar 👋

<!--
**JordiBolibar/JordiBolibar** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->

I am a postdoc researcher at Delft University of Technology (Netherlands). Previously I did my PhD at the Institut des Géosciences de l'Environnement, Université Grenoble Alpes, and before that I worked 4 years as a Software Engineer in industry.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
    - 🌎 [ODINN.jl](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/ODINN.jl): Global glacier model using Universal Differential Equations for climate-glacier interactions. Integrating the Julia differential programming tools with the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) in Python.
    - ❄️ [Huginn.jl](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/Huginn.jl): Fast and flexible glacier ice flow models in Julia. 
    - ❄️ [Muninn.jl](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/Muninn.jl): Machine learning-based glacier surface mass balance modelling.
    - 🧊 IceStupas: Artificial glacier modelling (i.e. Ice Stupas), investigating low-cost solutions for farmers and local populations facing climate change-induced droughts.
    - 🇦🇶 Antarctic Ice Shelves: Modelling calving of Antarctic ice shelves using deep learning and remote sensing data. 
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring new ways to mix differential equations and machine learning (i.e. Universal Differential Equations) for geoscientific models. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with people interested in Scientific/Physics-informed machine learning, or glacio-hydrological modelling.
