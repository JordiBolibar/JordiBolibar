### Hi there, I'm Jordi Bolibar 👋

<!--
**JordiBolibar/JordiBolibar** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->

I am a Research Scientist working at CNRS, IGE (France). Previously I worked as a postdoc reseacher at TU Delft and Utrecht University (Netherlands). I did my PhD at IGE, and before that I worked 4 years as a Software Engineer in the private sector.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
    - 🌎 [ODINN.jl](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/ODINN.jl): Global glacier model using Universal Differential Equations for climate-glacier interactions. Integrating the Julia differential programming tools with the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) in Python.
    - ❄️ [Huginn.jl](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/Huginn.jl): Fast and flexible glacier ice flow models in Julia. 
    - 🔥 [Muninn.jl](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/Muninn.jl): Machine learning-based glacier surface mass balance modelling for ODINN.jl.
    - 🏔️ [MassBalanceMachine](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/MassBalanceMachine): Machine learning glacier surface mass balance modelling to assimilate all data sources.
    - 🧲 [SphereUDE.jl](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/SphereUDE.jl): Universal Differential Equations for regression on the sphere, used to reconstruct past tectonic plate motion. 
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring new ways to mix differential equations and machine learning (i.e. Universal Differential Equations) for geoscientific models. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with people interested in Scientific/Physics-informed machine learning, or glacio-hydrological modelling.
